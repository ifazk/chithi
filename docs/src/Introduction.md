# Introduction

`chithi` is a command line tool to sync OpenZFS snapshots between local or
remote datasets. This is generally accomplished by passing appropriate options,
source, and target to the `chithi sync` command.

Beyond the `sync` command, there are additional commands and configuration
options available for running sync tasks by name.
